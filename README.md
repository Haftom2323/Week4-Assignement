  - Permission issues
  - Invalid file operations
  - Other unexpected errors

## How to Use
1. Place the source file in the project directory
2. Run the script: `python file_processor.py`
3. Follow the prompts to enter the source and destination filenames

## Example
```
Enter the source filename: sample.txt
Enter the destination filename: output.txt
File processed successfully! Check output.txt for the modified content.
```
